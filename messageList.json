Anyone can set up a server, set it's region, and so forth.\n **__Why should you use Discord over?__** \n Discordapp is based on servers. You could be in the middle of the desert or the ocean and still be able to talk to the server you're in as long as you have a stable connection to that sattelite! \n Discordapp was originally meant for gamers all over for PC but it turned into more. It turned into people using it as the new chatroom method, making friendships and making their own personal groups! Discord has so many different uses.
